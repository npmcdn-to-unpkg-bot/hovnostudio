                <p>In a previous life, Arielle Assouline-Lichten studied architecture at Harvard's Graduate School of Design, created graphics for Bjarke Ingels's Copenhagen office, built models for Snøhetta, and interned for Kengo Kuma. But she landed on our radar this spring after she began working for someone a little less famous: herself. This spring saw the launch of Slash Objects — a glamorous, assured debut furniture and object collection that mixes brass, marble, concrete, ceramic, and industrial rubber in endless combinations and at various scales.

                <p>Each year, we attend the Milan Furniture Fair, walking miles to hunt down the best furniture debuting in any given year. But most of the time, we end up never seeing some of our favorite pieces again, made as they are by European designers with little to no representation in the United States. Case in point: the amazing, primitive-chic furniture designed by Nata Janberidze and Keti Toloraia, the Georgian-based duo behind Rooms, which makes its American debut this week at The Future Perfect.</p>
